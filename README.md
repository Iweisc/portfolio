  --primary-color: #6a0dad; /* Main purple color */
  --primary-light: #9c27b0; /* Lighter purple for hover effects */
  --secondary-color: #2d3e50; /* Dark blue-gray for secondary elements */
  /* ... other colors ... */
}
```

### Adding/Removing Projects

To add a new project, copy the project card HTML structure and update the content:

```html
<div class="project-card">
  <div class="project-image">
    <img src="path-to-your-project-image.jpg" alt="Project Name">
  </div>
  <div class="project-info">
    <h3>Project Name</h3>
    <p>Project description goes here.</p>
    <div class="project-tags">
      <span>Technology 1</span>
      <span>Technology 2</span>
    </div>
    <div class="project-links">

      <a href="#" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-github"></i> Source Code</a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Updating Experience & Education

Modify the content within the tab sections to reflect your own experience and education:

```html
<div class="tab-content active" id="work">
  <div class="timeline-item">
    <h3>Your Job Title</h3>
    <p class="timeline-meta">Company Name â€¢ Start Year - End Year</p>
    <p>Description of your responsibilities and achievements.</p>
